# 1) Upload dataset
# 2) observe all columns and rows
# 3) some numerical data columns contain string type information we remove it
# 4) convert some columns like "gender","maritual_statuts","sports","soup","vitamns","coffee","breakfast","drink" ,"fries" (0's, and 1's )into numerical values
# 5) Rounded the "GPA" value into 1 decimal point
# 6) And some columns have "None" values that's also we remove it
# 7) Now we check null values and then we remove it
# 8) Drop rows that have any missing values
